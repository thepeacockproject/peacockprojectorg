Here's how to get up and running with Peacock.

-   Steps 2-3 may need to be repeated whenever Peacock receives an update (more info on the [Updating](./updating.md) page).
-   Steps 4-5 need to be repeated every time you launch the game. The game defaults back to the official servers otherwise.

1. Be sure to check the [requirements](./requirements.md) before reading further to ensure you have the required games / operating systems. **Xbox Game Pass / Microsoft PC version of Hitman 3 is not supported**, and [Linux users should check this page](../guides/./linux-setup.md).

2. [Download the latest Peacock release here](https://github.com/thepeacockproject/Peacock/releases/latest). Select `Peacock-vX.Y.Z.zip` to download.

    - Note: There is also a `Peacock-vX.Y.Z-lite.zip` option, but this is mainly for Linux users. The lite version does not include Node, which Linux users have to download separate binaries for anyways. If in doubt / not on Linux, download the non-lite version.
    - Refer to Step 1 for general Linux instructions.

3. Extract (unzip) files. Running the files from within the zipped folder will not work.

4. Navigate to where you installed Peacock, and run the files `Start Server.cmd` and `PeacockPatcher.exe`.

    - Depending on how you installed Peacock, you may need to open two folders to find these files, [as shown in this example image](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/833505136290299935/991068578579107870/unknown.png).

5. Now start up the game while `Start Server` and `PeacockPatcher.exe` are still running. The game should launch with Peacock server. Check the [FAQ](./faq.md) or ask in the `#help` channel on [Peacock Discord](https://thepeacockproject.org/discord) if you have trouble getting it to work.

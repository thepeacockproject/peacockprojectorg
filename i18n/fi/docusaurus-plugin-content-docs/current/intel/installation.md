Here's how to get up and running with Peacock.

1. Join the Peacock Discord server (https://thepeacockproject.org/discord).

2. [Download the latest Peacock release here](https://github.com/thepeacockproject/Peacock/releases/latest). Select `Peacock-vX.Y.Z.zip` to download.

    - Note: There is also a `Peacock-vX.Y.Z-lite.zip` option, but this is mainly for Linux users. The lite version does not include Node, which Linux users have to download separate binaries for anyway. If in doubt, download the non-lite version.
    - [More info for Linux Users](/wiki/guides/linux-setup)

3. Extract (unzip) files. Running the files from within the zipped folder will not work.

4. Navigate to where you installed Peacock, and run the files `Start Server.cmd` and `PeacockPatcher.exe`.

    - Depending on how you installed Peacock, you may need to open two folders to find these files, [as shown in this example image](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/833505136290299935/991068578579107870/unknown.png).

    - Note: If you are playing on Hitman 3, you will have to repeat steps 2-3 each time Hitman 3 receives a new update (more info on the [Updating](https://thepeacockproject.org/wiki/intel/updating) page). And for any of the three supported Hitman games, you will need to repeat step 4 every time you launch the game. The game defaults back to the official servers otherwise.

5. Now start the game. Check the [FAQ](https://thepeacockproject.org/wiki/intel/faq) or ask in the `#help` channel on [Peacock Discord](https://thepeacockproject.org/discord) if you have trouble getting it to work.

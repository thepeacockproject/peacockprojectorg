title: Progression Transfer
---

Peacock supports transferring your progress from official World of Assassination game servers. This will override all of your current progress on Peacock.

We currently only support same game and platform, for example, you can only go from Hitman 3 Steam â†’ Hitman 3 Steam.
Support for cross-game progression transfer is planned.

Check out the video tutorial above for a walkthrough of the progression transfer process. It may help to enable full-screen mode!

## How do I do it?

1. First, Start Peacock. Then connect to Peacock with the game. It is recommended that you now close the game.

2. Navigate to Peacock's Web UI, most users can [click here](http://localhost/) to access it.
   If Peacock is running on a different port, you can navigate to `http://localhost:PORT/` in a web browser.

3. Then, go to the **Progress Transfer** button on the nav bar at the top of the page.
   Choose the account you wish to transfer progress to.

4. Here you can see when you last transferred the progression of this account (if applicable).
   Now press the green **Sync Now** button.

5. A pop-up will display, **READ IT CAREFULLY** - this is your last chance to opt-out.

You will now see a pop-up box. If it is **green** then it was completed successfully!
If it was **red**, it failed, read below for some common issues and their fixes.

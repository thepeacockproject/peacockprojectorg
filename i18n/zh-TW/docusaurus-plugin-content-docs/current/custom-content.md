Peacock has lots of goodies packed in for our users. Here's a peek at our custom content!

## Escalations

### Custom Peacock Escalations

Peacock supports custom (Peacock original) escalations. These escalations are available in-game by default. You can see some custom escalations listed in the [Roadmaps](./roadmaps.mdx) as well.

### Official Server Escalations and Legacy Escalations

Peacock also supports all official server escalations, including Hitman 2016 escalations that have not been ported to Hitman 2 or 3 (legacy escalations). These escalations are available in-game by default.

- Note: You can select specific escalation levels to start on using the Escalation Level Picker tool, as explained [here](./intel/loadout-profiles-elp.md#escalation-level-picker)

## Contracts Mode

Peacock supports both official server and custom Peacock contracts.

### Featured contracts

This includes custom (Peacock original) contracts created by Peacock dev team. You can see some of these custom featured contracts [here](./roadmaps.mdx).

- **Note: Official Servers Featured Contracts are not included.**

#### How to Play

Go to `Game Modes` -> `Contracts` -> `Featured` menu in-game.

### User-Created Official Server Contracts

#### How to Install

- Note: This only works while the HITMAPS bot is authenticated for the platform in question.
  - [More info on how to authenticate it](https://bot.hitmaps.com/).
  - To check if it's online, run the command `/botstatus` in the `#bot-spam` channel in the Peacock Discord. The status is updated every 10 minutes.
- Go to `Game Modes` -> `Contracts` -> `Contract Lookup` menu in-game.
- Enter the official server contract ID (**Contracts from every platform except Nintendo Switch are supported for this**).
- The contract will now be downloaded in your `contracts` folder.

#### How to Play

Go to `Game Modes` -> `Contracts` -> `My Contracts` in-game to play.

### User-Created Peacock Contracts

#### How to Install

Download the contract's `.json` file from the `share-contracts` channel in Peacock Discord. Place the `.json` file in your `Contracts` folder, as shown here: ![](/img/wiki/contracts_folder.png).

#### How to create your own

- If you create a contract in-game while in Peacock server, your contract will be saved as an `.json` file in `Contracts` folder, as shown in the image above.
- Be sure to share your `.json` file in Peacock Discord's `share-contracts` channel if you want others to play your custom Peacock contract.

#### How to Play

- Go to `Game Modes` -> `Contracts` -> `My Contracts` in-game to play.

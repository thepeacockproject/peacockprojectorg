# Política de Privacidade do Peacock

We respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our Services, and this page describes how we use data collected, and for what purposes.

## Alcance

This policy applies to the following websites and products (collectively, the "Services"):

-   Todas as rotas que se iniciam com '/peacock' em backend.rdil.rocks.
-   Qualquer conteúdo exibido em thepeacockproject.org
-   Informações enviadas a nós usando o Servidor Peacock.

## Que informações coletamos?

When you view any of the pages this policy covers, exactly which page, as well as your IP address, and the time gets logged by us. This practice is typical and used by most websites. This information is stored on our servers for a maximum of 72 hours.

When you log in, the following information may be logged (in which case it is stored for a maximum of 1 business week), or stored in our database for long term data retrieval/storage:

-   Todos os detalhes salvos quando você visualiza a página (como destacado acima) (logado)
-   Informações básicas sobre a sua conta Discord (veja a documentação de desenvolvedor do Discord para saber quais informações são retornadas quando usando OAuth 2)
-   Exceto quando explicitamente foi desativado de tabelas de classificação, detalhes dos eventos ativados durante as missões, assim como detalhes de pontuação, são guardados em nossa base de dados.

## Para que usamos essa informação?

We use this data for purposes including:

-   Verificar que você está no Servidor do Discord
-   Atribuir cargos com base no seu status de proprietário no servidor Discord
-   Manter um acompanhamento das posições de tabelas de classificação e estatísticas, e para a moderação dessas tabelas de classificação.

## Requerimento da exclusão dos seus dados

Please contact a project admin on Discord, or email me [at symbol] rdil [dot] rocks.

## Excluindo onde possível

The Peacock server has the built-in capability as of recently released versions to opt out of certain features that may collect personal information.

To opt out of leaderboard data being submitted to our servers, run the server once, then edit the generated `options.ini` file, setting the `leaderboardsOptOut` value to `true`. To opt out of update checking, run the server once, then edit the generated `options.ini` file, setting the `updateChecking` value to `false`.

## Legal bases for information collection/usage

2. The use is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation; or
3. The use is necessary in order to protect your vital interests or those of another person; or

# Ghost Mode

The Peacock Project is happy to announce that we are running our own [LocalGhost](https://gitlab.com/grappigegovert/LocalGhost) server!

Ghost Mode for HITMAN™ 2 (and HITMAN™ 3 on Steam with a mod) has returned as an unofficial game mode! You and a friend can connect and invite each other to a friendly Ghost Mode match using Steam's invite system.

(_Matchmaking is not supported_).

Ghost Mode is available for PC players who own HITMAN™ 2 or HITMAN™ 3 on Steam.

## How to Connect

1. Download the LocalGhost Patcher from [here](https://gitlab.com/grappigegovert/localghost/-/jobs/artifacts/master/download?job=build_patcher).
2. Open the patcher, and select `ghostmode.rdil.rocks` on the drop-down menu.
3. If this is your first time running the patcher, open Advanced Settings, and untick the box labeled `Use http instead of https`. Then click save.
4. Start the game, press enter when prompted.
5. You are ready to play Ghost Mode!

Want to go back to the official servers? Just close the patcher and restart the game.

## Use in HITMAN™ 3

To use Ghost Mode in HITMAN™ 3 (Steam version only), you need to install a client-side mod to the game. The mod can be obtained [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/hitman3/mods/260).

## Side Notes

-   Peacock and LocalGhost are not the same thing. LocalGhost supports Ghost Mode, and Peacock does not.
-   This Ghost Mode server is run by The Peacock Project team, but _is not Peacock itself_!

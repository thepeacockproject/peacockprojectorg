    -   Note: You should open Hitman with Peacock before following the steps in this tutorial. In addition, Peacock has received a new update, so now just go to `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` in your browser instead of `localhost/loadouts`. When you are on the `localhost` page, click on `Loadout Profiles` in the upper left navbar. Then proceed with the rest of the video tutorial.

## Escalation Level Picker

-   To pick specific escalation levels, run `Start Server.cmd` from your Peacock Install folder, then open up a web browser and go to `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`. Go to `Escalation Level Picker` and proceed from there following instructions on screen.

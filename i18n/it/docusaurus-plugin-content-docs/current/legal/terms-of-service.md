title: Terms of Service
description: Peacock's Terms of Service.
---

While we aren't lawyers, we do have some terms and conditions that must be followed.

## Terms

"We", "Us", "Our", and "Peacock" shall mean The Peacock Project team. "You" shall mean the consumer.

## Binding

By using Peacock or any related services, you agree to these terms, as well as the terms set in the [Privacy Policy](privacy-policy.md).

## Access

We agree to provide access to Peacock for select owners of the HITMAN&trade; series. We have the right to deny you access if you don't own the game, or if we decide to deny access for any reason.

## Licensing

As of October 20th, 2022, Peacock is an open-source project under the [GNU Affero General Public License, version 3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html).

## Donations

Since Peacock costs the team to build and keep going, anybody has the option to donate money to help fund the project. All donations are non-refundable. Donations are not required, but much appreciated.

## Plugins

We encourage authorized users to create plugins to add, change, or remove functionality from Peacock. Plugin developers are allowed to modify Peacock through our internal plugin system, assuming modifications made do not violate any other rules laid out in this document. While the plugin system is an official feature of Peacock, unless otherwise stated, plugins are not provided by nor endorsed by The Peacock Project. We provide no liability, warranty, or support for these plugins. If you wish to become a plugin developer, and gain access to our official plugin development resources, contact an admin on Discord.

## Interpretation

All translations are provided purely for informational purposes. In case of discrepancy between the English text and any translations, the English version shall prevail.

## Change

This policy may change at any time at our discretion. We will attempt to notify you of any changes, but in some cases, we may not be able to. The date this policy was last modified can be found at the bottom of this page. Additionally, you can view the revision history of this page [here](https://github.com/thepeacockproject/peacockprojectorg/commits/main/docs/legal/terms-of-service.md).

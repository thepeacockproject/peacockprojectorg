title: Elusive Targets
---

On Peacock, you can play all Elusive Targets in the game.
Our implementation of Elusive Targets is simple: you can play them whenever you want, and finish or fail the missions as
many times as you want, with no time penalties.

## 如何游玩

On HITMAN&trade; 2016, you will see an Elusive Targets tile on the main menu.

For other game versions, after starting up the game with Peacock, scroll right on the top bar of the main menu.
Click the `Career` tab, then select the `Elusive Targets` tile.

:::info The Brothers

You may see an Elusive Target on the menu titled "The Brothers", which the game will say you are missing the required
content for.
This Elusive Target is cut/unfinished content, and while the files are in the game, it needs to be activated by using
mods.

Check out [this mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/hitman3/mods/375) by community member Kevin Rudd which adds back and
polishes the mission.

Having an error with the patcher? Here's a guidebook on the most common errors and how to remedy them.

## `Unknown version`

This error occurs when the patcher encounters a version of the game that it doesn't know how to find the relevant data.

Here are the most common causes:

- You are using an unsupported version of the game (e.g. the Microsoft Store version). These versions of the game won't
  work with Peacock. Please check our [supported versions guide](../intel/requirements.md).
- You are using an out of date version of the game. Try updating your game to the latest version.
- Verify your game files. Also, ensure you haven't tampered with the game's `.exe` file.

## `Only part of a wpm was completed`

This happens when the patcher encounters an error mid-way through its process.
Usually, this is a temporary error that can be resolved by restarting your computer.

If it continues, try verifying your game files.

After verifying your game files, if it still isn't resolved, contact us on [Discord](/discord).

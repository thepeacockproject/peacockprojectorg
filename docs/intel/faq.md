## Troubleshooting FAQ

### Wrong Game Version / Platform

-   Check the [Requirements](./requirements.md) section of this guide, make sure you have a supported game version and platform, etc.
    -   **Xbox Game Pass / Microsoft PC version of Hitman 3 is not supported (commonly asked)**.
    -   Check [Linux Setup Guide](../guides/./linux-setup.md) if on Linux.
-   Make sure you have the latest versions of Hitman and Peacock, older versions may not be supported.

### Try to Reconnect

-   Make sure Peacock Patcher is set to "Peacock Local" option and not "IOI Official" when you are trying to connect to Peacock.
-   It may take a few tries to connect to Peacock. If you can't connect, try going back to the Peacock Patcher application and clicking on "Re-patch" until the Peacock Patcher shows "Successfully patched ID".
-   If your game is already connected to the official servers, you may need to disconnect the game from official servers first to connect to Peacock. To disconnect from official servers, go to "Options" from the Hitman 3 main menu, then "Privacy Policy", then "Opt out". Then when you reconnect you should be on Peacock.
-   To return to Official servers, you can go offline while connected to Peacock, then toggle the Peacock Patcher application to patch you to Official Servers, then go "online" again to connect to official servers.
-   **If you still have trouble connecting, then continue to the next section below.**

### Connection Troubleshooting

-   As explained in the [What is Peacock](./what-is-peacock.md) page, **you need to be connected to the Internet, at least initially, to use Peacock**. This is to get past Steam / Epic verification. After connecting to Peacock the first time, you may disconnect from the Internet and stay connected to Peacock for the duration of your game session.
    -   If you have a phone with cellular data plan, you can use the phone as hotspot for your computer to connect to Internet.
-   Don't try to use Peacock if it's literally your first time playing the game. You need to connect to the official servers at least once before you can connect to Peacock. After you've connected to official servers at least once you no longer have to do so in the future in order to use Peacock.
-   Try running the `PeacockPatcher.exe` as admin.
-   Keep the option "Use http instead of https" in Peacock patcher ticked unless you are playing Ghost Mode.

-   Peacock by default uses Port 80 on your PC for the Peacock server.

    -   If possible, check whatever process is currently using Peacock by typing `netstat -ano | find ":80" | find "LISTEN"` into your terminal, and then checking "Details" tab of Task Manager to find the process based on PID of whatever is on Port 80.
    -   If you use Visual Studio, you may have installed some services that interfere with Peacock by also running on Port 80. To fix:

        1. Press the Windows key and R at the same time
        2. Type services.msc in the popup box, then hit ok
        3. Check for W3SVC: World Wide Web Publishing Service and Web Deployment Agent Service in the service manager
        4. Disable both if present
        5. Try again, if it doesn't work, restart your computer, then try once more

    -   Here's how to change the port Peacock uses, if you don't want to stop the process on Port 80:
        -   In the instructions below, please substitute `PORTNUMBER` with a port that is not currently running on your PC, e.g. `8080`, `6969`, `3000`, etc.
        -   Change `Start Server.cmd` to be as follows:
        ```
        @echo off
        SET PORT=PORTNUMBER
        .\nodedist\node.exe chunk0.js
        PAUSE
        ```
        -   Type `localhost:PORTNUMBER` or `127.0.0.1:PORTNUMBER` into the server window, as shown here: ![](../../static/img/./patcher_port.png)

### Missing Items / Maps

-   Starting from v6, Peacock should be able to automatically detect when you obtain a new DLC, and give you access to those new items / maps

### Other

-   Check [Peacock Unique Features](../intel/loadout-profiles-elp.md) page for info on how to set multiple loadouts per map or choose specific escalation levels with Peacock.
-   Default Suits - If you tick `getDefaultSuits = true` in your `options.ini` file in your Peacock Install folder, please note the following behavior:
    -   Any discussion for "default suits" below refers to the version of the default suit **without gloves** - whichever version of the suit you normally would use for that level when starting it up for the first time ever.
    -   Some Hitman 2 and Hitman 3 default suits are not usable in all maps in the vanilla game. This can be fixed using https://www.nexusmods.com/hitman3/mods/401/
    -   If you choose not to use the above mod, then note the following:
        -   Season 1 default suits (e.g. Summer Suit from Marrakesh): Works on all maps
        -   Season 2 default suits (e.g. Casual Tourist from Santa Fortuna): Works on Season 2 and 3 Maps
            -   New York and Maldives (Haven) are included in Season 2
        -   Season 1 default suits (e.g. Neon City Suit from Chongqing): Works on Season 3 Maps Only
        -   Ambrose Island is outside of the Season system so to speak, Ambrose Default suit (Guerilla Wetsuit) is usable on all maps, and all maps' Default Suits can be used in Ambrose

    -   See above link for questions on progression (challenges and mastery etc), Freelancer integration with Peacock, whether or not you need Internet to use Peacock, or any other general questions on how Peacock works

## Feature Request FAQ

-   Before asking any questions about Ghost Mode, escalations, user contracts, elusive targets, please check the [Custom Content Page](.././custom-content.md) as well as the [Ghost Mode Page](.././ghost-mode.md).
-   Mod Compatability:
    -   Most mods are compatible with Peacock; there are only three kinds that aren't.
        -   If a mod edits contracts (missions, special assignments, etc.), it'll need a Peacock plugin to be compatible.
        -   If a mod edits the planning inventory (that is, changes the properties of starting locations, changes which items you can bring into missions, or edits the suits available to you), it will also need a plugin.
        -   Menu changes may also sometimes be incompatible, but should otherwise be fine. Other than those, mods should be compatible with Peacock without any effort on the part of the mod creator.

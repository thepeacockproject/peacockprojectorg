Peacock is essentially a Hitman server emulator that runs on your own PC.

When you start the game, it doesn't connect to IOI's servers, only Peacock.

## How does Peacock Work?

Here's a brief breakdown of what Peacock does:

-   Peacock lets you access Hitman's rating system without being connected to IOI's servers.
    -   **Note: Peacock is not a fully offline experience.**
    -   Each time you start the game, you will initially need to be connected to the internet still, to pass Steam or Epic verification.
    -   After you have passed Steam / Epic verification and have connected to Peacock, you are free to disconnect your internet if you like and you will stay connected to Peacock for the duration of your game session.
-   **In general, as of Peacock v6.3.1, challenges, mastery, progression, scoring, earning merces (Freelancer) are all supported, and the experience is 1:1 with the official servers experience**
    -   Minor Exception: Some challenges, especially for Freelancer, may have some minor bugs. Please report any issues to the Peacock Discord `#help` channel (https://thepeacockproject.org/discord).
    -   Please check the `options.ini` file in your Peacock install folder for any additional configuration tweaks, such as **turning progression / challenge completion on and off** (e.g. if you want to get all unlocks right away on purpose).
    -   **By default, progression / challenge completion is turned on to simulate an official servers experience.**
    -   If it is your first time playing (on either Peacock or official servers), some exits will be locked. You will need to unlock Dubai exits ([need to unlock the elevators](https://youtu.be/IEQgRQyQRf8)), Dartmoor exits ([need to exit via bike at least once](https://youtu.be/AJtJZe9jEi8?t=151)), and Colorado exits ([need to use tornado exit at least once](https://youtu.be/3XKWHrKpXwk?t=140)). These exits are handled client-side.
-   Peacock lets you play [custom](../custom-content.md) or otherwise discontinued / time limited content such as [Ghost Mode](../ghost-mode), Sniper co-op, escalations, elusive targets, and contracts.
    -   Both official server escalation / elusive targets / contracts and custom / modded ones are supported, see [here](../custom-content.md) for more info.
-   Display leaderboards for other Peacock users (Cross Platform, Epic and Steam)
-   In Game Saving is supported, and as of Peacock v5.0.1 you can load official server saves in Peacock.

:::info Trivia: Why name it Peacock?

Peacock is the name that the game uses in its source code for the mission "The Showstopper", which ushered in a new era of Hitman. Hence, the reason for the name "Peacock".

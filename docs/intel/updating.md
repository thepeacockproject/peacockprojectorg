description: When should I update? How do I update? A guide on everything you need to know about updating.

1. When you run `Start Server.cmd`, you may get an alert that Peacock is out of date, as shown in this example image: ![](../../static/img/./peacock_out_of_date.png).
2. Usually you will need to update Peacock only when there is a new game update, but stay tuned in the Peacock Discord's `#updates` and `#downloads` channels to be safe.
    - Note: Peacock may be temporarily unavailable after a game update, as it takes a few hours for the Peacock Patcher to be updated as well.
3. If there is a new Peacock update, go to the [latest Peacock release on Github](https://github.com/thepeacockproject/Peacock/releases/latest) to download the latest build.
4. Extract (unzip) files. Running the files from within the zipped folder will not work.
5. **Assuming you have used Peacock during the previous game update**, follow the instructions below to keep your loadouts and in-game savefiles (Otherwise, your loadouts will all default back to ICA19/coins/fiberwire, and your in-game save files will be lost).

    - Copy your old `userdata` and `contractSessions` folders from your previous Peacock Install folder, and paste it into your new Peacock Install folder. Replace any existing files in the new Peacock build's folder, if necessary.
    - Check this example image if you have trouble finding the `userdata` and `contractSessions` folders: ![](../../static/img/./userdata_contractsessions.png)

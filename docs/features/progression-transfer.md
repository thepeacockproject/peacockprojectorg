title: Progression Transfer
---

Peacock supports transferring your progress from official World of Assassination game servers. This will override all of your current progress on Peacock.

We currently only support same game and platform, for example, you can only go from Hitman 3 Steam → Hitman 3 Steam.
Support for cross-game progression transfer is planned.

## How do I do it?

1. First, Start Peacock. Then connect to Peacock with the game. It is recommended that you now close the game.

2. Navigate to Peacock's Web UI, most users can [click here](http://localhost/) to access it.
If Peacock is running on a different port, you can navigate to `http://localhost:PORT/` in a web browser.

3. Then, go to the **Progress Transfer** button on the nav bar at the top of the page.
Choose the account you wish to transfer progress to.

4. Here you can see when you last transferred the progression of this account (if applicable).
Now press the green **Sync Now** button.

5. A pop-up will display, **READ IT CAREFULLY** - this is your last chance to opt-out.

You will now see a pop-up box. If it is **green** then it was completed successfully!
If it was **red**, it failed, read below for some common issues and their fixes.

## Common Issues

### Failed to get official authentication data

**IF YOU DID NOT CONNECT TO PEACOCK FIRST**: Go back to step 1 with your reading glasses on.

If you did: are you sure? Did you see the Peacock dashboard? Go back to step 1 and ensure you follow them.

**DO YOU OWN THE GAME?** If you don't, it won't work.

### Failed to sync official data

Ensure you followed all steps outlined above. **ENSURE YOU OWN THE GAME.**
